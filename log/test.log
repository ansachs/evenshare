For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.041740"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.041740"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.048019"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.048019"]]

For the second set, they have invited various Chicago experimentalists to join them.</p> \n<p><b>Michael Zerang</b></p> \n<p>Michael Zerang was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is a first-generation American of Assyrian decent. He has been a professional musician, composer, and producer since 1976, focusing extensively on improvised music, free jazz, contemporary composition, puppet theater, experimental theater, and international musical forms.</p>\n<p>As a percussionist, composer and collaborator, Zerang has over one hundred titles in his discography and has toured nationally and internationally to 35 countries since 1981, and works with and ever-widening pool of collaborators, primarily in The United States, Western and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2004, Zerang began to work with musicians and artists living in the Middle East. He traveled to perform, hold workshops, and study, to Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. </p>\n<p>In November, 2007, Zerang played his first concert in Poland. Between 2007 - 2015, he had performed over 100 concerts. Several of these concerts where from existing ensembles that visited Poland, but the majority of the concert were in collaboration with Polish musicians and artists.</p>\n<p>Michael founded and was the artistic director of the Link's Hall Performance Series in Chicago from 1985-1989 where he produced over 300 concerts of jazz, traditional ethnic folk music, electronic music, and other forms of forward thinking music. He was a Board Member of Links Hall from 1989 - 2013. He continued to produce concerts at Cafe Urbus Orbis from 1994-1996, and at his own space, The Candlestick Maker in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood, from 2001 - 2005.</p>\n<p>Zerang has collaborated extensively with contemporary theater, dance, and other multidisciplinary forms and has received three Joseph Jefferson Awards for Original Music Composition in Theater, in collaboration with Redmoon Theater, in 1996, 1998, and 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael has taught as a guest artist at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in performance technique, sound design, and sound/music as it relates to puppetry; rhythmic analysis for dancers at The Dance Center of Columbia College, Northwestern University, and MoMing Dance and Arts Center; courses in Composer/Choreographer Collaborations at Northwestern University; music to children at The Jane Adams Hull House.</p>\n<p>Michael currently tours and holds workshops in improvisational music and percussion technique, and teaches private lessons in rhythmic analysis, music composition, and percussion technique.</p> \n<p><b>Jim Baker</b></p> \n<p>Jim Baker is an eccentric and deep-thinking musician who has jammed with some of the best in the world, from Chicago flautist and bandleader Nicole Mitchell to Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore, of Massachusetts. His talent and humor shines in his solo Delmark CD, More Questions Than Answers, which is the perfect album to let play on repeat for auditory relaxation or intense retrospection ‚Äî depending on your mood. If you‚Äôve not seen and heard Baker labor like a scientist or switchboard operator over the complex assemblage of cables, pedals and knobs that he uses to control his ARP synthesizer, then you‚Äôve not experienced the best Old School electronic music that gets played in Chicago. - Chicago Jazz Festival, 2012</p> \n<p><b>Aaron Zarzutzki /Carol Genetti</b></p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8471120], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.049766"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.049766"]]

However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 20:54:40.295527"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 20:54:40.295527"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world.

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 20:56:14.244228"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 20:56:14.244228"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world.

His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.966829"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.966829"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.972751"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.972751"]]

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.148975"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.148975"]]

Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey.

Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E.

Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.155091"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.155091"]]

For the second set, they have invited various Chicago experimentalists to join them.</p> \n<p><b>Michael Zerang</b></p> \n<p>Michael Zerang was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is a first-generation American of Assyrian decent. He has been a professional musician, composer, and producer since 1976, focusing extensively on improvised music, free jazz, contemporary composition, puppet theater, experimental theater, and international musical forms.</p>\n<p>As a percussionist, composer and collaborator, Zerang has over one hundred titles in his discography and has toured nationally and internationally to 35 countries since 1981, and works with and ever-widening pool of collaborators, primarily in The United States, Western and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2004, Zerang began to work with musicians and artists living in the Middle East. He traveled to perform, hold workshops, and study, to Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. </p>\n<p>In November, 2007, Zerang played his first concert in Poland. Between 2007 - 2015, he had performed over 100 concerts. Several of these concerts where from existing ensembles that visited Poland, but the majority of the concert were in collaboration with Polish musicians and artists.</p>\n<p>Michael founded and was the artistic director of the Link's Hall Performance Series in Chicago from 1985-1989 where he produced over 300 concerts of jazz, traditional ethnic folk music, electronic music, and other forms of forward thinking music. He was a Board Member of Links Hall from 1989 - 2013. He continued to produce concerts at Cafe Urbus Orbis from 1994-1996, and at his own space, The Candlestick Maker in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood, from 2001 - 2005.</p>\n<p>Zerang has collaborated extensively with contemporary theater, dance, and other multidisciplinary forms and has received three Joseph Jefferson Awards for Original Music Composition in Theater, in collaboration with Redmoon Theater, in 1996, 1998, and 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael has taught as a guest artist at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in performance technique, sound design, and sound/music as it relates to puppetry; rhythmic analysis for dancers at The Dance Center of Columbia College, Northwestern University, and MoMing Dance and Arts Center; courses in Composer/Choreographer Collaborations at Northwestern University; music to children at The Jane Adams Hull House.</p>\n<p>Michael currently tours and holds workshops in improvisational music and percussion technique, and teaches private lessons in rhythmic analysis, music composition, and percussion technique.</p> \n<p><b>Jim Baker</b></p> \n<p>Jim Baker is an eccentric and deep-thinking musician who has jammed with some of the best in the world, from Chicago flautist and bandleader Nicole Mitchell to Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore, of Massachusetts. His talent and humor shines in his solo Delmark CD, More Questions Than Answers, which is the perfect album to let play on repeat for auditory relaxation or intense retrospection ‚Äî depending on your mood. If you‚Äôve not seen and heard Baker labor like a scientist or switchboard operator over the complex assemblage of cables, pedals and knobs that he uses to control his ARP synthesizer, then you‚Äôve not experienced the best Old School electronic music that gets played in Chicago. - Chicago Jazz Festival, 2012</p> \n<p><b>Aaron Zarzutzki /Carol Genetti</b></p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8471120], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.156520"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.156520"]]

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.454817"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.454817"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.460965"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.460965"]]

Between 2007 - 2015, he had performed over 100 concerts. Several of these concerts where from existing ensembles that visited Poland, but the majority of the concert were in collaboration with Polish musicians and artists.</p>\n<p>Michael founded and was the artistic director of the Link's Hall Performance Series in Chicago from 1985-1989 where he produced over 300 concerts of jazz, traditional ethnic folk music, electronic music, and other forms of forward thinking music. He was a Board Member of Links Hall from 1989 - 2013.

The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:06:28.691616"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:06:28.691616"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:06:28.704313"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:06:28.704313"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:06:28.706961"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:06:28.706961"]]

In this exclusive demonstration class, Eataly partner and noted restaurateur Joe Bastianich will be offering an intimate vertical tasting of three vintages of Vespa Bianco, the flagship wine of the Bastianich winery. The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:07:17.418836"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:07:17.418836"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:07:17.424651"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:07:17.424651"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:07:17.431188"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:07:17.431188"]]

The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:10:48.549055"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:10:48.549055"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:10:48.559815"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:10:48.559815"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:10:48.562288"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:10:48.562288"]]

In this exclusive demonstration class, Eataly partner and noted restaurateur Joe Bastianich will be offering an intimate vertical tasting of three vintages of Vespa Bianco, the flagship wine of the Bastianich winery. The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:11:02.386788"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:11:02.386788"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:11:02.392569"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:11:02.392569"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:11:02.394650"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:11:02.394650"]]

The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:14:52.003410"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:14:52.003410"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:14:52.009089"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:14:52.009089"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:14:52.011142"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:14:52.011142"]]

In this exclusive demonstration class, Eataly partner and noted restaurateur Joe Bastianich will be offering an intimate vertical tasting of three vintages of Vespa Bianco, the flagship wine of the Bastianich winery. The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:24:20.417580"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:24:20.417580"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:24:20.423384"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:24:20.423384"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:24:20.425439"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:24:20.425439"]]

The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:03.471843"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:03.471843"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:03.482786"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:03.482786"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:03.485091"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:03.485091"]]

In this exclusive demonstration class, Eataly partner and noted restaurateur Joe Bastianich will be offering an intimate vertical tasting of three vintages of Vespa Bianco, the flagship wine of the Bastianich winery. The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:57.785701"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:57.785701"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:57.791379"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:57.791379"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:57.793515"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:25:57.793515"]]

The Bastianich winery was founded in 1997 in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Friuli is known for its ‚Äúsuper whites,\" meaning white wines that have the same aging potential as reds.</p><p><br></p><p>Made from two very complex international grapesthat have adapted in Friuli, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% of the indigenous varietal Piccolit, Vespa Bianco is a wine to drink fresh or to age. Guests will also have the opportunity to learn about Grana Padano, a semi-fat hard cow's milk cheese produced along Northern Italy's Po River Valley that has a firm and deeply straw-colored rind which protects its fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù in Italian, which is reflected in the cheese's fine granular texture. In this class, guests will taste three different ages of Grana Padano (12 months, 18 months, and Riserva 27 months) and enjoy a 2-course demonstration cooking class featuring Grana Padano taught by Eataly's chef of La Scuola, alongside three vintages of Vespa Bianco.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Additional Information</em><br>‚Ä¢ Please note, class includes a cooking demonstration with a multi-course meal and is not hands-on. <br>‚Ä¢ Seating is guaranteed but is first-come, first-served.

As FKJ, aka French Kiwi Juice, his loose and colourful arrangements could soundtrack anything: a house party in Hong Kong, a road trip through the Australian outback, a post-midnight walk alone across moonlit European streets. It‚Äôs all there on his 2017 self-titled debut album, which flits between fidgety electronics, smooth blues and pristine pop, all with the flick of a switch.\n<br /><br />FKJ‚Äôs universal appeal goes a long way to explaining his current, impressive border-crossing rise. With every song on his debut racking up over a million Spotify plays, he‚Äôs sold out shows in Asia, Europe and the States, and his unique, spontaneity-first live delivery ‚Äì frog-leaping between guitar, keys and sax ‚Äì is capable of translating to both intimate and giant venues.\n<br /><br />Fenton‚Äôs journey began as a teenager, where he started to compose songs in-between working as a sound engineer in a Tours, France cinema. Self-taught and self-starting, he learnt the ropes on countless instruments, before finding an early home on future-facing French collective / label Roche Musique.\n<br /><br />2012 EP Time for a Change set a stall for slick, sophisticated, cinematic pop. But if this release got by on an anything-goes approach, 2017‚Äôs French Kiwi Juice goes even further, upping the ante on collaborations and a global mission. Filipina singer (((O))) guests on the serene ‚ÄòSkyline‚Äô, while the minimalistic ‚ÄòLying Together‚Äô samples LA rapper Domo Genesis. Throughout, there‚Äôs a sense that no idea, however ambitious, is dismissed out of hand by Fenton. And the title of the record‚Äôs closing track acts as something of a mantra for his work: ‚ÄòWhy Are There Boundaries‚Äô.\n<br /><br />With the debut turning heads worldwide and a follow-up in the works, the past year‚Äôs also seen FKJ perform live sessions with a couple of kindred spirits: South London producer Tom Misch, and sax-glued Virginia talent Masego ‚Äì both of which have been viewed by millions. It makes sense that artists like FKJ and his collaborators are allowed to flourish more than ever. After all, music can be accessed in an instant from just about anywhere in the world. No back catalogue is untraceable, no matter how extensive the Discogs search. You can be influenced by just about anything, no matter what the country or musical era.

Fronted by the poly-rhythmic, jocular drumming of Andrew Barr, the songs and guitar playing of brother Brad Barr, and the innovative harp wizardry of Sarah Page¬¥‚Äìwho has single-handedly redefined the instrument and its context. The group has been expanding and contracting its sound and its size from their home base in Montreal, QC. Bass, pedal steel, keyboards, and horns come in and out of the mix freely. Equally at home in solemn Arcadian ballads, swampy North African improvs, or classic rock and roll revelry, The Barr Brothers continue to embrace and enchant audiences with their methodical-yet-whimsical approach to music making.\n<br /><br />The two brothers and Sarah began performing Brad‚Äôs songs around North America, bringing in other friends on other instruments when needed, spinning these otherwise bedroom- folk songs into an intricate, open terrain. The link they maintain to the past fuses wonderfully with poetic insight into the conditions of the present, while incorporating everything from Malian rhythms to the Elmore James-esque slide guitar. Homemade percussion instruments reminisce the likes of Tom Waits‚Äô five-years-buried muffler and a Jockey Full of Bourbon, while reviving Celtic folk traditions, polyrhythmic harp interplay, and the fire of West African Blues.\n<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers (2011) dances a fine line between the crossroads of Robert Johnson, Arthurian ballads, and the poetic sensibilities of Leonard Cohen. Their sophomore album, Sleeping Operator (2014) delves deeper into the connections between the Delta blues and its ancestry in West and North Africa, while still rooting itself in the softness of Appalachian folk and the soaring resilience of a song‚Äôs connective tissues. The group‚Äôs favourite misfits of the album were released on the five-track collection Alta Falls (2015), that drifts further northward, having been partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Siguro¬®sson (Bjo¬®rk, Sigur Ro¬¥s, Nico Muhly). It reveals ethereal folk and layered vocal harmonies whose warmth is suggested by the red vinyl it is pressed onto.\n<br /><br />The success of this natural yet unfamiliar convergence of influences has enabled The Barr Brothers to perform in, among other places, the Levon Helm studios of Woodstock NY, the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, twice on the ‚ÄúLate Show with David Letterman‚Äù, Japan, Europe, the UK, as well as earning them two Juno nominations in 2013 and 2015 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. In this next year, these vast and varied influences will find themselves experimenting yet again with the recording of a third full-length album, and will further be celebrated as Mali‚Äôs Bassekou Kouyate¬¥ and partner Amy Sacko come to join forces with the group. Two unprecedented collaborative performances are set to take place in Quebec City and Montreal in the summer of 2017 (as part of the Festival d‚ÄôE¬¥te¬¥ de Que¬¥bec and Festival International de Jazz de Montre¬¥al respectively), where both figurative and literal blending of these musical traditions will be on full brilliant display."], ["ticket_info", "$17 [$20 Doors], 21+"], ["api_id", 8402948], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:26:16.631608"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:26:16.631608"]]

This performance will be recorded live.\n<br /><br />$10 ADVANCE | $15 DOORS\n<br /><br />CLICK HERE TO BUY TICKETS\n<br /><br />Chicago Farmer, the moniker Bloomington, Illinois Cody Diekhoff performs and writes under, released his 7th album titled Midwest Side Stories on September 30, 2016. Midwest Side Stories is about hope, depression, job loss, meth, skateboards, a divided nation, used cars, the late shift, farms, factories, the destruction of our environment, and still being around to sing about it. The new release contains ten tracks all of which were written by Diekhoff (pronounced dee-cough), with the exception of the John Hartford classic Im Still Here.\n<br /><br />Folk hero Todd Snider says, I love Chicago Farmers singing and playing and songs, but its the intention behind the whole of his work that moves me to consider him the genuine heir to Arlo Guthrie or Ramblin Jack Elliott. He knows the shell game that goes on under folk music which is sacred to me. Chicago Farmer is my brother; if you like me, youll love him.\n<br /><br />Lyrically driven, Chicago Farmer delves into the social and political issues of todays world, taking it all in and putting it back out through music as a commentary on modern times in the Midwest. With his unfeigned and relatable approach, Chicago Farmer has earned a place in the heart of this generations rise of protest songs. He composes music written and sung by and for the working man, the regular person, bringing to mind modern day folk tales.\n<br /><br />I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain. This is the opening stanza to the first song Umbrella, a song that speaks of the power of music in peoples lives and is dedicated to songwriters everywhere, including many of whom weve lost in 2016.\n<br /><br />With heartfelt observations of the world around him, Chicago Farmer has been around the folk scene for a while now singing the stories he has written along the way, aiming to capture the essence of the human condition and putting it all on display. He has gotten to know a variety of players over the years and brought together a wonderful cast of musicians to perform on the album. Diekhoff co-produced Midwest Side Stories, with engineer Chris Harden at I.V. Labs Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Harden also played Glockenspiel and harmonized vocals on select tracks. Others on the album include vocalist and guitarist Ernie Hendrickson, drummer Darren Garvey, vocalist Heather Horton, and a handful of other Midwestern mainstays.\n<br /><br />Cody has his finger on the pulse of middle America. Coming from a long line of family farmers and factory workers in central Illinois and growing up in a rural farming community has inspired many songs that are autobiographical in nature. Farms & Factories is a workgrass song featuring fiddle, tempo changes, and the farming side of Chicago Farmer. In 2002 he moved up north to the big city where he came up with the name Chicago Farmer for what was initially intended to be a band, but ended up keeping the name for himself and started writing and recording albums. Eventually he moved back in 2008 to central Illinois where he makes his home in Bloomington. The Midwest is where he was born and raised. Its where he first started to write poetry and where he would eventually set those words into motion with his guitar.\n<br /><br />Midwest Side Stories captures everything that Chicago Farmer is capable of as a performer, songwriter and story teller. He draws you in with the emotion in his voice and holds you captive with the lyrical pictures he paints about the real struggle the common man is up against."], ["ticket_info", "$10 - $15"], ["api_id", 8569654], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:26:16.642448"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:26:16.642448"]]

Since beginning his career in 2005, Ripp's songs and records have successfully impacted a diverse and growing audience including true music lovers: fans that appreciate the nuances of a well crafted album, and easy listeners: fans who simply want to hear a catchy tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an awe-inspiring voice is one thing, but knowing how to use that voice to share lyrics and emotion in a way that moves those who hear the songs is quite another. Ripp has grown in this over the years as a respected songwriter with the voice of an artist. Won't Let Go comes on the heels of Andrew Ripp celebrating a #1 album on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart in 2010 with his album \"She Remains The Same,\" which was the follow-up to his debut album in 2008 \"Fifty Miles to Chicago.\" Ripp, who is originally from Palatine, IL and now resides in Nashville, TN, is no stranger to the national music scene beginning his career as a songwriter and co-writing half of Ryan Cabrera's 2005 album \"You Stand Watching,\" including \"You Shine On,\" which landed on Billboard's Hot 100. Ripp has had a hand in writing songs that have been featured on \"American Idol,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Live To Dance.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his last release, Andrew spent time writing and writing, not just creating a few songs and depending on his voice to carry the album. \"The good ones,\" Andrew says, speaking of excellent artists, \"they leave space in the songs.\" And over the last two years, Andrew has learned that skill. Having moved to Nashville with his wife at the encouragement of fellow musician and mentor, GRAMMY-nominated artist Dave Barnes, Andrew settled into the songwriting town and began to hone his talents and grow as an artist, musician, and songwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new album, \"Won't Let Go,\" is full of the picks of the songwriting litter, with songs that resonate with the hearer as well as the creator. Working with award-winning producer Charlie Peacock (Civil Wars, Amy Grant, Holly Williams, Switchfoot) Andrew handed full control to him, allowing the songs to drive the recording process, not trying to turn the songs into something they weren't. You can hear that too -- the wrestling, the release, the emotion, the growth of the songs to a new sound that somehow feels familiar.¬†</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A touring artist as well, Andrew's live performances continue to move the audience in just the right ways. Crowds don't want him to leave the stage when the show is over, and he's not sure he's ready to leave either. He has opened for and toured the country with artists including Jon Foreman, needtobreathe, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; the Sixers, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Ripp continues to tour around the country in support of his forthcoming release \"Won't Let Go,\" for the audiences that have supported him throughout the years as well as the new ones he continues to steadily make along the way.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$20 - $35"], ["api_id", 8577771], ["concert_date", "2017-12-08 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:26:16.644579"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:26:16.644579"]]

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:28:32.512099"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:28:32.512099"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:28:32.552336"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:28:32.552336"]]

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:34:28.458322"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:34:28.458322"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:34:28.494462"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:34:28.494462"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:35:58.644616"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:35:58.644616"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:35:58.682214"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:35:58.682214"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:36:50.829650"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:36:50.829650"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does.

Sometimes the sun sets. Although you may prefer to live in the sunshine, what can really matter is what you choose to do in the darkness. When the sun went down, musician Keithen realized that he had to let his little light shine. Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus. From there I used to listen to her sing all the time,‚Äù the artist reminisced.<br /><br />Banks has the opportunity to reach people. Banks is using his platform as a singer at the House of Blues to help heal people. He is also a life coach, does motivational speaking and has even made an appearance on the season one finale of ‚ÄúEmpire.‚Äù His efforts to help others heal through music was publicly acknowledged when he was awarded ‚ÄúThe Black Excellence Award for R&B‚Äù by the African American Arts Alliance of Chicago. Even though Banks has experienced domestic violence, homelessness and childhood trauma, he is still determined to let his little light shine by raising his kids and helping others through his music.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:06.723105"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:06.723105"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:06.772778"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:06.772778"]]

As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:39.153391"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:39.153391"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:39.200911"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:39:39.200911"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:42:53.213745"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:42:53.213745"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:42:53.271649"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:42:53.271649"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:33.827745"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:33.827745"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:33.871913"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:33.871913"]]

Sometimes the sun sets. Although you may prefer to live in the sunshine, what can really matter is what you choose to do in the darkness. When the sun went down, musician Keithen realized that he had to let his little light shine. Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus. From there I used to listen to her sing all the time,‚Äù the artist reminisced.<br /><br />Banks has the opportunity to reach people. Banks is using his platform as a singer at the House of Blues to help heal people. He is also a life coach, does motivational speaking and has even made an appearance on the season one finale of ‚ÄúEmpire.‚Äù His efforts to help others heal through music was publicly acknowledged when he was awarded ‚ÄúThe Black Excellence Award for R&B‚Äù by the African American Arts Alliance of Chicago. Even though Banks has experienced domestic violence, homelessness and childhood trauma, he is still determined to let his little light shine by raising his kids and helping others through his music.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:45.648644"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:45.648644"]]

He began in the rave scene, spinning progressive, breaks, and jungle, and found house music to be his greatest love, drawing influences from cinematic scores and classic disco. His appreciation of uplifting vocals was a natural fit with the gay circuit and led to DJ gigs of all kinds, from tea dances to afterhours. He's had the pleasure of spinning for Lady Gaga, \"Wonder World\" weekend at Disney World and, through a process of blind selection against nearly 50 other DJs from all over America and around the world, the headlining spot at the annual \"REAL BAD\" party in San Francisco, following Folsom Street Fair.\n<br /><br />Since REAL BAD XXII, he's graced the decks as headliner in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Denver, Dallas, and Sydney, Australia. His remix work with Bryan Reyes, including Fierce Angel artist Peyton's \"Love So Strong\" (with John LePage & Paul Goodyear) and Leona Lewis & Avicii's \"Collide\" is supported by DJs around the world. As a solo remixer, he's remixed Matt Consola feat Ben Holder \"Feels Like Heaven\" and Wayne G \"When You Talk About Love\" (vocals by Shauna Jensen) and \"With Or Without You\" (vocals by Brian Kent).

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:45.701505"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 04:48:45.701505"]]

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:02.741141"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:02.741141"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:02.792211"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:02.792211"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:56.387547"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:56.387547"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:56.433915"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:00:56.433915"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:01:41.932680"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:01:41.932680"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:01:41.968323"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:01:41.968323"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:12:41.340815"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:12:41.340815"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:12:41.390184"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:12:41.390184"]]

Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:26.961753"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:26.961753"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:26.996629"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:26.996629"]]

Sometimes the sun sets. Although you may prefer to live in the sunshine, what can really matter is what you choose to do in the darkness. When the sun went down, musician Keithen realized that he had to let his little light shine. Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus. From there I used to listen to her sing all the time,‚Äù the artist reminisced.<br /><br />Banks has the opportunity to reach people. Banks is using his platform as a singer at the House of Blues to help heal people. He is also a life coach, does motivational speaking and has even made an appearance on the season one finale of ‚ÄúEmpire.‚Äù His efforts to help others heal through music was publicly acknowledged when he was awarded ‚ÄúThe Black Excellence Award for R&B‚Äù by the African American Arts Alliance of Chicago. Even though Banks has experienced domestic violence, homelessness and childhood trauma, he is still determined to let his little light shine by raising his kids and helping others through his music.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \"Bright Beginnings\" and the atmospheric rumination of \"Great Hosannas\" are just further indication that he's quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre.</p>\r\n<p>His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \"Messenger\" (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \"I never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey -- electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler -- upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn't make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\" The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival.</p>\r\n<p>The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \"It was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We've got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\"</p>\r\n<p>But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \"In retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren't there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job....as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\" At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \"I just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\"</p>\r\n<p>The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \"The aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that's what I love about music, and that's what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\" The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we've gotten to a road map to Pug's ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it's easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \"Veteran Fighter\" wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \"The Measure,\" a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner's novel Godric, marvels at \"every inch of anguish, laid out side by side\" but ultimately finds that \"All we've lost is nothing to what we've found.\" \"I never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\" Pug explains. \"When you're sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it's probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\" This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \"If Still It Can't Be Found,\" which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron.</p>\r\n<p>If it's not around this corner it's around the next<br>If it's not beyond this river it's beyond the next<br>And if still it can't be found<br>It's prob'ly for the best</p>\r\n<p>As the saying goes, \"All's well that ends well.\" Joe Pug didn't call it quits after all. He's engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$22-$32"], ["api_id", 8451770], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 02:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:38.990059"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:38.990059"]]

Originally released on October 30, 2017, the album received high praise for its stark presentation of wartime life. </p>\n<p>The Gunshy‚Äôs Matt Arbogast on There‚Äôs No Love In This War:</p>\n<p>From 1943 until 1945, my grandfather Paul Arbogast spent his days preparing for, fighting, recovering from, and again fighting a war. The songs that comprise There‚Äôs No Love In This War are based on the seventeen letters he wrote to the girl he met at the Ukranian Club at home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the year before he left.</p>\n<p>Paul and Julia were married six months after he returned and in 1947 she gave birth to their first child, my father Mark. Paul passed away at the age of 39 of a heart attack, attested mainly to the shrapnel still in his chest from wounds received at Anzio in 1944.</p>\n<p>Though she never spoke in detail of Paul, my grandmother Julia had no other man in her life. She passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>These songs are his, though they may not do him justice. I‚Äôve never fought in a war and hope to always be able to say that.\r\nArbogast self-released those attic songs in 2002 as his debut album, To Remember/To Forget, and began a seven week tour immediately. His travels introduced him to a world of comradere, booze, and sleeping on floors that quickly became his home. His second album, No Man's Blues, was initially self-released, then quickly re-released in 2004 by Latest Flame Records, who had been given a copy by his tourmates at the time, Troubled Hubble. Impressed by the album and Arbogast's conviction, they were anxious to offer their support. After critical acclaim and lengthy touring behind No Man's Blues, Arbogast relocated The Gunshy to Chicago. With the big city came the addition of more instrumentation to his songs. The result, 2005's Souls, was perceived by critics and admirers alike as a great step forward for The Gunshy. On the day of it's release, Julia Simon of Spin.com wrote, \"If Matt Arbogast's debut as The Gunshy wasn't enough to catapult him into the storytelling ranks of Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Silver Jews' David Berman -- those kings of self-referential literariness -- his third LP, Souls, will.\"</p>\n<p>Though his songs have allowed him to travel the States nineteen times and join most of his favorite artists on stage, Arbogast still maintains the DIY ethics that initially allowed him to do what he loves. He often prefers art spaces or house shows to the typical club setting. \"It's sad and frustrating that the most popular form of art is so often restricted to those of drinking age. I drink plenty, but would prefer to play a living room of ten people listening to songs than a bar of hundreds too drunk to listen,\" he says. He's the type of performer you'll find watching other bands play or drinking a beer with his host on the couch in someone's living room, rather than hiding backstage with his rider of expensive liquor.</p>\n<p>When he's not on the road (which is only about half the year), you'll find Matt either at the Green Eye on Western and Milwaukee in Chicago, at a show around town, writing and recording songs, or keeping in touch with those he's met on the road. He may not be handwriting all of those correspondences as his grandfather did, but you will hear in these songs from whom Matt inherited his wordsmith abilities‚Ä¶Please listen to and enjoy There Is No Love In This War, out October 30, 2007 on Latest Flame Records.</p>\n<p>The Gunshy's There's No Love In This War: Matt Arbogast, Andrew Bryant, Kara Eubanks, Jeff Grabowski, Ben Grigg, Dan Hanke, Andrew Lanthrum, Adam Penly, Hawley Shoffner, Corey Wills.</p> \n<p><b>Andrew Bryant</b></p> \n<p>Nobody right now does reflection and interiority better than Andrew Bryant. He‚Äôs always stopping to look. Starting again and recalibrating. Asking questions. The songs on Ain‚Äôt It Like\r\nthe Cosmos provide complex observations about work, fatherhood, love, and longing. What does it even mean to be a father and a husband and a son? What‚Äôs it mean to be from a place? To truly live in a place? To feel trapped in a place? To feel freed by work and music and love? The album is rooted in sensory details. This intimacy gives us access to Bryant‚Äôs memories and fears. The thing that wrecks me most is the sincerity in his voice when he sings a line like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to\r\nlet you down / I just want to drink some booze‚Äù on ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù It‚Äôs the kind of line that allows you to insert yourself into the story of the song. Bryant‚Äôs narrators are always concerned with being better men, with leaving behind the things that bog them down, be it blood, place, or bad habits. Shaving your beard and throwing out your liquor can be a big accomplishment, as is the case on ‚ÄúI Am Not My Father‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\r\nThe fifth track, ‚ÄúPractical Man,‚Äù supplies us with the album‚Äôs mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to ask what it all means / and I‚Äôve always tried to get down to the heart of things / But the older I get the less it matters to me / I‚Äôm a practical man at the end of the day / I used to be the kind to hide my mistakes / Bury them in a mix of guitars and bass / But the older I get the more I want them in my face.‚Äù It‚Äôs an uncompromising statement, one that makes clear\r\nBryant‚Äôs preoccupations. How do you strip things down to the bare essentials? How do you embrace and learn from mistakes? Like his heroes Jason Molina and David Bazan, Bryant is reckoning with time and failure and the past, and he‚Äôs trying to find hope in this savage world.\r\nHe‚Äôs trying. He‚Äôs doing the nasty work of living. He‚Äôs not going to look away. He‚Äôs going to face it head on.\r\n‚ÄúThe Price Was Right‚Äù is one of the album‚Äôs great heartbreakers: ‚ÄúI call my mother / Her name is Paula / She‚Äôs having trouble with her mind / We talk about Shiloh / She grew up there / Sometimes I smell her chicken pie.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs a master at these simple, human moments. He can hit that yearning place like no one else I can think of. Kell Kellum‚Äôs pedal steel roams in the background on this song (and on so many of these songs), giving us the sensation that the music\r\nis on our tail on some long dark road. You can smell the melancholy like pine trees heavy in the air.\r\nElsewhere, on ‚ÄúBittersweet,‚Äù Bryant sings: ‚ÄúLord, ain‚Äôt it bittersweet this place we call our home / Ain‚Äôt it like the cosmos to light up the magnolias at dawn.‚Äù If the world‚Äôs savage, if Mississippi can be a difficult place to understand and exist in, there are these moments of intense beauty to give it meaning and balance it all out. These songs are perilous with the push and pull between life and death, the recognition that everything is fleeting. One minute you‚Äôre playing ball with your son in the yard, as in ‚ÄúThe Price Was Right,‚Äù the next minute you just want to ‚Äúcheck another night off your list,‚Äù like the narrator of ‚ÄúEverything in This World.‚Äù Bryant goes on in ‚ÄúBittersweet‚Äù: ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it like the cosmos to play every card in the deck?‚Äù The business of living is sloppy. We find our foundations in ways we couldn‚Äôt have expected.\r\nAnd now the first for last. ‚ÄúRobert Downey Jr‚Äôs Scars‚Äù is the most urgent album opener since Songs: Ohia‚Äôs ‚ÄúFarewell Transmission.‚Äù It‚Äôs the song where Bryant espouses his code with strutting brutality: ‚ÄúIron Man was on the TV / I was pouring myself another beer / Thinking about all the pain that‚Äôs in my heart / Thinking about Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs scars / And, man, I\r\nknow just what it takes / Yeah, I know just what it takes to start again.‚Äù He does. You spin your mistakes into magic. You do the work. You put the hammer down and do the work.\r\n‚ÄîWilliam Boyle</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8622219], ["concert_date", "2017-12-07 03:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:39.035233"], ["updated_at", "2017-12-03 05:13:39.035233"]]

Sometimes the sun sets. Although you may prefer to live in the sunshine, what can really matter is what you choose to do in the darkness. When the sun went down, musician Keithen realized that he had to let his little light shine. Keithen Banks was born in Chicago Heights, one of the south suburbs of Chicago, but raised in a small town in Mississippi by his grandmother. As a kid, he spent time going back and forth between Illinois and Mississippi. Eventually, he moved to Mississippi with his grandmother because his mother was having physical complications. ‚Äú[My] grandmother was a very very religious woman‚Ä¶ She raised me up with Jesus. From there I used to listen to her sing all the time,‚Äù the artist reminisced.<br /><br />Banks has the opportunity to reach people. Banks is using his platform as a singer at the House of Blues to help heal people. He is also a life coach, does motivational speaking and has even made an appearance on the season one finale of ‚ÄúEmpire.‚Äù His efforts to help others heal through music was publicly acknowledged when he was awarded ‚ÄúThe Black Excellence Award for R&B‚Äù by the African American Arts Alliance of Chicago. Even though Banks has experienced domestic violence, homelessness and childhood trauma, he is still determined to let his little light shine by raising his kids and helping others through his music. Sometimes the sun shines. Sometimes the sun sets. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the darkness.

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.041740"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.041740"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.048019"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.048019"]]

For the second set, they have invited various Chicago experimentalists to join them.</p> \n<p><b>Michael Zerang</b></p> \n<p>Michael Zerang was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is a first-generation American of Assyrian decent. He has been a professional musician, composer, and producer since 1976, focusing extensively on improvised music, free jazz, contemporary composition, puppet theater, experimental theater, and international musical forms.</p>\n<p>As a percussionist, composer and collaborator, Zerang has over one hundred titles in his discography and has toured nationally and internationally to 35 countries since 1981, and works with and ever-widening pool of collaborators, primarily in The United States, Western and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2004, Zerang began to work with musicians and artists living in the Middle East. He traveled to perform, hold workshops, and study, to Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. </p>\n<p>In November, 2007, Zerang played his first concert in Poland. Between 2007 - 2015, he had performed over 100 concerts. Several of these concerts where from existing ensembles that visited Poland, but the majority of the concert were in collaboration with Polish musicians and artists.</p>\n<p>Michael founded and was the artistic director of the Link's Hall Performance Series in Chicago from 1985-1989 where he produced over 300 concerts of jazz, traditional ethnic folk music, electronic music, and other forms of forward thinking music. He was a Board Member of Links Hall from 1989 - 2013. He continued to produce concerts at Cafe Urbus Orbis from 1994-1996, and at his own space, The Candlestick Maker in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood, from 2001 - 2005.</p>\n<p>Zerang has collaborated extensively with contemporary theater, dance, and other multidisciplinary forms and has received three Joseph Jefferson Awards for Original Music Composition in Theater, in collaboration with Redmoon Theater, in 1996, 1998, and 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael has taught as a guest artist at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in performance technique, sound design, and sound/music as it relates to puppetry; rhythmic analysis for dancers at The Dance Center of Columbia College, Northwestern University, and MoMing Dance and Arts Center; courses in Composer/Choreographer Collaborations at Northwestern University; music to children at The Jane Adams Hull House.</p>\n<p>Michael currently tours and holds workshops in improvisational music and percussion technique, and teaches private lessons in rhythmic analysis, music composition, and percussion technique.</p> \n<p><b>Jim Baker</b></p> \n<p>Jim Baker is an eccentric and deep-thinking musician who has jammed with some of the best in the world, from Chicago flautist and bandleader Nicole Mitchell to Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore, of Massachusetts. His talent and humor shines in his solo Delmark CD, More Questions Than Answers, which is the perfect album to let play on repeat for auditory relaxation or intense retrospection ‚Äî depending on your mood. If you‚Äôve not seen and heard Baker labor like a scientist or switchboard operator over the complex assemblage of cables, pedals and knobs that he uses to control his ARP synthesizer, then you‚Äôve not experienced the best Old School electronic music that gets played in Chicago. - Chicago Jazz Festival, 2012</p> \n<p><b>Aaron Zarzutzki /Carol Genetti</b></p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8471120], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.049766"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 17:59:12.049766"]]

However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 20:54:40.295527"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 20:54:40.295527"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world.

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 20:56:14.244228"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 20:56:14.244228"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world.

His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.966829"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.966829"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.972751"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:04:31.972751"]]

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.148975"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.148975"]]

Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey.

Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E.

Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.155091"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.155091"]]

For the second set, they have invited various Chicago experimentalists to join them.</p> \n<p><b>Michael Zerang</b></p> \n<p>Michael Zerang was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is a first-generation American of Assyrian decent. He has been a professional musician, composer, and producer since 1976, focusing extensively on improvised music, free jazz, contemporary composition, puppet theater, experimental theater, and international musical forms.</p>\n<p>As a percussionist, composer and collaborator, Zerang has over one hundred titles in his discography and has toured nationally and internationally to 35 countries since 1981, and works with and ever-widening pool of collaborators, primarily in The United States, Western and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2004, Zerang began to work with musicians and artists living in the Middle East. He traveled to perform, hold workshops, and study, to Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. </p>\n<p>In November, 2007, Zerang played his first concert in Poland. Between 2007 - 2015, he had performed over 100 concerts. Several of these concerts where from existing ensembles that visited Poland, but the majority of the concert were in collaboration with Polish musicians and artists.</p>\n<p>Michael founded and was the artistic director of the Link's Hall Performance Series in Chicago from 1985-1989 where he produced over 300 concerts of jazz, traditional ethnic folk music, electronic music, and other forms of forward thinking music. He was a Board Member of Links Hall from 1989 - 2013. He continued to produce concerts at Cafe Urbus Orbis from 1994-1996, and at his own space, The Candlestick Maker in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood, from 2001 - 2005.</p>\n<p>Zerang has collaborated extensively with contemporary theater, dance, and other multidisciplinary forms and has received three Joseph Jefferson Awards for Original Music Composition in Theater, in collaboration with Redmoon Theater, in 1996, 1998, and 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael has taught as a guest artist at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in performance technique, sound design, and sound/music as it relates to puppetry; rhythmic analysis for dancers at The Dance Center of Columbia College, Northwestern University, and MoMing Dance and Arts Center; courses in Composer/Choreographer Collaborations at Northwestern University; music to children at The Jane Adams Hull House.</p>\n<p>Michael currently tours and holds workshops in improvisational music and percussion technique, and teaches private lessons in rhythmic analysis, music composition, and percussion technique.</p> \n<p><b>Jim Baker</b></p> \n<p>Jim Baker is an eccentric and deep-thinking musician who has jammed with some of the best in the world, from Chicago flautist and bandleader Nicole Mitchell to Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore, of Massachusetts. His talent and humor shines in his solo Delmark CD, More Questions Than Answers, which is the perfect album to let play on repeat for auditory relaxation or intense retrospection ‚Äî depending on your mood. If you‚Äôve not seen and heard Baker labor like a scientist or switchboard operator over the complex assemblage of cables, pedals and knobs that he uses to control his ARP synthesizer, then you‚Äôve not experienced the best Old School electronic music that gets played in Chicago. - Chicago Jazz Festival, 2012</p> \n<p><b>Aaron Zarzutzki /Carol Genetti</b></p>"], ["ticket_info", "$10, 21+"], ["api_id", 8471120], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.156520"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:07:59.156520"]]

For the past few years Adam has been pushing his craft in new, exciting directions and carving out a unique spot for himself in today‚Äôs international musical landscape, with both his virtuosity and musicianship earning him great success along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than ten million hits on YouTube and a strong following on all social media platforms, it is clear Adam is a bonafide star in the internet world. However, his success is certainly not limited to the web, having performed around the globe in major international music festivals and shared stages with some of the world‚Äôs fusion giants ‚Äì including Pat Metheny, Victor Wooten and Richard Bona ‚Äì over the last few years. His work has been shown at industry leading publications, such as BBC World Service, CBS News, Time Magazine and The British Telegraph to name but a few. Jazz FM has defined his appearance as ‚Äùa dazzling virtuosity and breath-taking athletic performance‚Äù.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‚Äúmulti-instrumentalist‚Äù is often overused but in this case it couldn‚Äôt be more fitting; Adam began playing the violin at age five and picked up the guitar at age nine. Over the years he has added the Piano, Clarinet, Oud, Side Flute and even BeatBox to his arsenal, largely teaching himself each time. However, it was an introduction to the Double-Bass at age 16 that truly changed his life, when he instantly fell in love with the instrument‚Äôs rich sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing inspiration from heroes as diverse as Bach, Sting, Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea, Adam made a clear decision to make his compositions current ‚Äì no matter the tool used. He has consciously added new colors to his palette, incorporating elements of Jazz, Latin and Mediterranean music into his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is playing original material or his wonderfully crafted cover arrangements, ABE is a creative force of nature who can transform a room full of strangers into lifelong fans in a moment. Regardless if he‚Äôs performing solo, duo or as part of his Trio with guitar and percussion, no two shows are alike as he expertly moves from one instrument to the next, sometimes within the same song, without ever missing a beat. Using a smart combination of effects and pedals, Adam regularly loops his notes in order to deliver an authentic wall of sound, worthy of a small orchestra. With a rise in requests for international appearances and a need to push his instrument further, Adam commissioned a special one-of-a-kind 5 strings bass with an unusual removable neck setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both his Trio album (Can‚Äôt Stop Running, 2015) and latest Solo album (Pin Drop, 2017) showcase not just a virtuoso performer but also a sensitive composer with no musical boundaries, combining elements of jazz, rock and world music to create a sweeping, fascinating and versatile sound.</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$17 - $30"], ["api_id", 8326602], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.454817"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.454817"]]

Grammy-nominated Howard already has a stunning catalog of music wide ranging in style ‚Äì from the breezy ‚ÄúCome Share My Love‚Äù and the steamy funk of ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt Nobody Like You‚Äù to her soul-stirring signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management,‚Äù the jazzy ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù and the inferno that is ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs What Love Is‚Äù (her duet with the late, great Gerald Levert). Miki has recorded eight albums but none quite like her new 7-song EP, I Choose to Be Happy from the Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Blues Collection. She considers this CD of live and studio material the first in a forthcoming series of mini albums: Miki Howard Reality Music Record Series #1. The proud veteran states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making music for the soundtrack of the times we are living in now.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>The lead single is ‚ÄúPanther,‚Äù an affirmative declaration on the power of maturity and wisdom set to a raw Primal Funk of hand drum percussion, horns and chants co-produced by Miki with Jon Nettlesbey. In the lyric she proclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a diva, I‚Äôm a Sacagawea,‚Äù name-checking the woman that assisted early America explorers Lewis &amp; Clark. Miki shares, ‚ÄúYou have to be a soldier for what you believe in. Some people get stuck in the trenches of adversity - a Panther soldiers through. In the music, I was going for a Kanye West kind a thing ‚Äì a BIG sound that stands out on the radio.‚Äù With a sly smile she adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the natural sexuality we women have between the rocking chair and the rocking cradle!‚Äù ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is available in a remix featuring Oakland rapper Too $hort, a move that might surprise fans of the jazzy R&amp;B queen‚Ä¶though it shouldn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI did a lot of concerts early on with DJ Quik, Tone-Loc and N.W.A with Ice Cube and Eazy-E. I‚Äôve known $hort since the early `90s and we‚Äôre still cool.‚Äù<br><br>In keeping with the concept of ‚ÄúPanther‚Äù is an intrigue-filled remake of ‚ÄúSoon I‚Äôll Be Loving You Again,‚Äù a song from Marvin Gaye‚Äôs boudoir classic Motown LP I Want You (1976) that he co-wrote with living legend Leon Ware. Miki picked right up on its provocative lyric and shares it today from an evolved woman‚Äôs point of view. ‚ÄúMost men my age these days are married or this-n-that. So I tend to date younger men and find myself literally giving them knowledge. ‚ÄòLet me give you some head in terms of a heads up ‚Äì some cerebral head of spiritual light.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>Also revealing are ‚ÄúThe Days of Wine and Roses‚Äù a reality version of a song about love at its best, the memories of pure love from our mom‚Äôs; and the emptiness one feels when it‚Äôs gone; and finally ‚ÄúI Choose To Be Happy‚Äù a mantra extracted from her signature ‚ÄúLove Under New Management‚Äù that Miki and her 16-piece band (under the direction of Japanese female Musical Director Noriko ‚ÄúCoko‚Äù Olling) recorded live at Hollywood‚Äôs Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Sunset Blvd. These songs are about as naked and soul baring as an artist dare to be before an audience. ‚ÄúThose songs were recorded on the fourth show of two nights, two shows a night. I was really hoarse but liked it so much that I left them. They are sincere and real.‚Äù</p>\r\n<p>Miki was born Alicia Michelle Howard in Chicago, Illinois on September 30, 1960 - the daughter of gospel singers Clay Graham (Pilgrim Jubiliees) and Josephine Howard (Caravans). During her childhood in Chicago and Detroit, Miki met some of the best singers of the day. Early influences included family friends Dinah Washington and Aretha Franklin. Her first musical instrument was the harmonica her grandfather gave her. After her mother moved the family to Los Angeles, 15 year-old Miki received her first break when Augie Johnson, leader of the flashy vocal outfit Side Effect, spotted her in a beauty pageant and invited her to join his guys and gals group in `78. Also joining Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson‚Äôs At Home Productions, Miki sang backup for jazz greats Roy Ayers and Grover Washington, Jr., as well as Earth Wind &amp; Fire‚Äôs Philip Bailey, Charlie Wilson and the Gap Band, among others.<br><br>Miki Howard was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records in the mid-`80s and recorded her first solo album, Come Share My Love, in 1986 featuring the R&amp;B Top 5 title track and earning her a Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist. Following 1988's Love Confessions (f/ \"Baby Be Mine\"), her third album, Miki Howard (1989), featured her first R&amp;B #1 single \"Ain't Nuthin' in the World\" (penned and produced by Jon Nettlesbey &amp; Terry Coffey). A move to Giant Records in 1991earned Miki her second R&amp;B #1 with \"Ain't Nobody Like You\" from her CD Femme Fatale which also featured a smoky rendition of Billie Holiday‚Äôs \"Good Morning Heartache.\"Casting director Robi Reed saw Miki perform Holiday tunes at Radio City Music Hall and offered her the chance to portray the legend in a nightclub scene for Spike Lee's 1992 epic, ‚ÄúMalcolm X.‚Äù In 2001, Miki recorded an album for Peak/Concord entitled Three Wishes receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&amp;B Recording. <br>Today, Miki Howard is the proud single mother of three: sons Nicholas (a Head Chef) and Brandon (an entertainer), and daughter Kaitlen (also an entertainer). The grandmother of four (nickname: ‚ÄúG-Ma‚Äù) has also been profiled on the popular Black Music documentary TV series ‚ÄúUnsung.‚Äù Miki confidently reports, ‚ÄúIn this internet age, your phone is your radio. And I found my life with social networking. It‚Äôs like sitting at a round table with people from all over the world. So don‚Äôt call this a ‚Äòcomeback!‚Äô <br><br>Welcome to Miki‚Äôs Forward March.‚Äù</p>"], ["ticket_info", "$42-$55"], ["api_id", 8451766], ["created_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.460965"], ["updated_at", "2017-11-30 21:09:41.460965"]]

Between 2007 - 2015, he had performed over 100 concerts. Several of these concerts where from existing ensembles that visited Poland, but the majority of the concert were in collaboration with Polish musicians and artists.</p>\n<p>Michael founded and was the artistic director of the Link's Hall Performance Series in Chicago from 1985-1989 where he produced over 300 concerts of jazz, traditional ethnic folk music, electronic music, and other forms of forward thinking music. He was a Board Member of Links Hall from 1989 - 2013.
